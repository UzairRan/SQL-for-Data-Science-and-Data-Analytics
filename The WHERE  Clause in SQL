The WHERE Clause in SQL

The WHERE clause in SQL is used to filter rows from a table based on specified conditions. It allows 
you to narrow down the result set to only those rows that meet the specified criteria.

Example:

Let's say we have a table named "employees" with columns "employee_id", "first_name", 
"last_name", and "department_id". We want to retrieve the first name and last name of employees 
who belong to the 'Marketing' department.

SQL code:
SELECT first_name, last_name
FROM employees 
WHERE department_id = 'Marketing'; 

In this example:
• SELECT first_name, last_name: Specifies that we want to retrieve data from the "first_name" 
and "last_name" columns.

• FROM employees: Specifies that we want to retrieve data from the "employees" table.

• WHERE department_id = 'Marketing': Specifies the condition that the value in the 
"department_id" column must be 'Marketing' for the rows to be included in the result set.
